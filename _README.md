Gremlins.js
=================

This small script finds those strange gremlins Photoshop and other tools create when inserting linebreaks in their text editors and replaces them with UTF-8 encoded characters, making them readable in HTML.

It also gives you the option to replace natural line breaks with <br> tags, making it easier to copy paste into a code editor.
